It seems that while we experiment with some new era steam irons that coming from Tefal
we found out that there is a "hidden" technical menu that can be accessed through the buttons of the front panel.

To be able to use the menu, we had to keep the "water/decal" button (most of the times it can be found on the right side of the panel)
while we plug the device to mains. The device will start up and instantly the water pump will start working for two seconds. When it stops,
we press once the steam button on the iron, which activates the menu on the panel. Pressing the buttons that lighting on the panel seems like is 
picking options or testing the device. 

Sadly I couldn't find any useful information on the web about this specific "menu" and it's uses, in case you have any ideas, please let me know.

Greetings fellow git'ers

I started this Git as I jumped into a new career path as a home appliances technician. My previous experience and degree with computer systems, networks and applications, robotics and homelab equipment seems pretty useful, but there are tons of stuff to be learned yet :)
Many times I struggle with some specific devices which become a pain, since their boards (yeap, more electronic parts, more chances for faulty ones) may be faulty and there is no way to find any schematics or support to fix 'em.
I though that it is going to be a great addition for anyone who may stuck in such situation, by the time I will add different devices that I do believe they worth to be shared here (since I will need help to fix them)
Feel free to enjoy all the information and also share your thoughts and experiences

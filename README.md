Greetings fellow git'ers

I started this Git as I jumped into a new career path as a home appliances technician. My previous experience and degree with computer systems, networks and applications, robotics and homelab equipment seems pretty useful, but there are tons of stuff to be learned yet :)
There are many times that I struggle with some devices which become a pain since their boards may be faulty and there is no way to find any schematics or support to fix em.
I though that it is going to be a great addition for anyone who may stuck in such situations, by the time I will keep adding different devices that I do believe they worth to be shared here (since I will need help to fix them)
Feel free to enjoy all the information and also share your thoughts and experiences

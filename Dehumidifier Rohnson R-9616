We encountered a faulty coil sensor on a specific device, which was manifesting as the "E1" error.

Upon consulting the English version of the manual, we stumbled upon an explanation.
As it turns out, the coil sensor is essentially an ordinary temperature sensor with two contacts. 
When we tested the component's resistance, we couldn't identify any issues. 
Therefore, we decided to perform a device reset by simultaneously
holding the power button and connecting the device to the mains.

The LED screen initiated a countdown from 9 to 0, yet afterward, nothing transpired.
We remained stuck with the same error. In a bid to resolve the issue, we experimented
with a different temperature sensor, and after performing a reset, the device resumed normal operation.

We had a faulty coil sensor on a this specific device. We were seeing the error "E1".

While checking the English version of the manual we found the explanation. The coil sensor is just an ordinary
temperature sensor with two contacts. By checking the resistance of the component we didn't found any issue
so we did a reset to the device by holding the power button and plug the device to mains.
The led screen starts counting from 9 to 0 and then nothing happened, since we had the same error.
We tried another temperature sensor and after a reset the device started operating again.

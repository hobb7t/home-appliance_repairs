Board: AQUA PRO POWER PCBA PP V3.5
Microprocessor: PIC16F1936-E/SO

Found a faulty device that keeps pumping water onto the boiler too frequently
which finally makes the iron to blow hot water and not steam (even by starting the system 
with an empty boiler) it takes about 20-35 minutes to drown in water and stop functioning as intended.

*Can't say for sure if the problem comes from a faulty passive electronic components or the microprocessor itself.

At the exact moment my electronics knowledge is "very 'much basic'" plus I don't have an oscilloscope to be able to test anything except some components.
